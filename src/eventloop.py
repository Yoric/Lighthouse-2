# This EventLoop class enables event-based asynchronous programming where
# the events are GPIO button presses and timers. Typically, you create
# an EventLoop object, call monitorGPIOButton() one or more times to
# configure one or more buttons and then call the loop() method. The loop()
# method generally never returns: it blocks until an event occurs, then
# invokes the callback associated with that event, and then loops again
# waiting for another event.
#
# In addition to monitoring GPIO pins for events, you can also use later()
# to invoke functions after specified delays.
#
# Call exit() to force loop() to exit. In typical use, this will also make
# your entire program exit.

    # event queue to call the callback function with three arguments:
    #  - the pin number
    #  - the pin value: a 1 if the pin is now high or a zero if low
    #  - the time when the state change occurred
    #
    # By default, the button is expected to be wired between the pin and ground
    # and the pin will use the built-in pull-up resistor. In this default case
    # the pin will read high when the button is not pressed and will read
    # low when the button is pressed. If you wire your button to +3.3v instead
    # of ground, then pass pull_up=False to configure the pin to pull down.

    # different amounts of bounce, however, so set debounce_time to a larger
    # value if your button requires it.

    # This is a higher-level version of monitorGPIOPin() that makes a
    # GPIO push button behave something like a GUI pushbutton. It can
    # detect clicks, double clicks and long presses. The callback
    # function is invoked whenever an event occurs. The first argument
    # to the callback is a string that specifies the event, and the
    # second argument is the pin number.
    #
    # If the user just clicks the button, the callback will be called
    # three times with arguments "press", "release" and "click". There
    # will be a short delay between the "release" event and the
    # "click" event to make sure that the click is not just the start
    # of a double-click. (Specify the doubleclick_speed argument to
    # control the length of this delay.)
    #
    # If the user double-clicks the button quickly enough, the
    # callback will be called five times: "press", "release", "press",
    # "doubleclick", "release"
    #
    # If the user presses and holds for long enough, the callback will
    # be called three times: "press", "longpress", "release". Specify
    # the longpress_duration argument to control how long the user must
    # hold the button down to trigger a longpress event.
    #
    # Most callers can ignore callback invocations where the first
    # argument is "press" or "release". Typically they will only want
    # to respond to the higher-level "click", "doubleclick" and
    # "longpress" events.
